🤖 Simple Robot Arm Using Arduino

This project demonstrates a simple robotic arm controlled using an Arduino board. It's designed as a basic introduction to robotics and servo motor control, making it perfect for beginners, students, and hobbyists.

🔧 Features

    1. Controlled using Arduino UNO/Nano
    2. Uses standard hobby servo motors (SG90 or MG90S)
    3. Easily extendable for future upgrades (e.g., Bluetooth, sensors, or joysticks)

🧰 Components Used

    1. Arduino board (UNO, Nano)
    2. jumper wires
    3. 4 x SG90 9g plastic servo motor
    4. IR remote control module with receiver and battery
    5. screws & nuts with fasteners
    6. 4DOF acrylic robot arm kit

📁 How It Works

Each servo motor controls a part of the robot arm (base, shoulder, elbow, and gripper).
